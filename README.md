## Deindustrialization and it's Regional Effects in Chicago - A look back to the last 40 years.

The city of Chicago, thanks to its centralized location and evolution of its ports and railroad
centers, has for so long been associated with the fields of manufacturing and industry. From milling, and
meatpacking plants to the printing and metal-manufacturing industries, Chicago was once one of the
Midwest’s most famous cities for being host to thousands of manufacturing related jobs – an industry
which, as Enrico Moretti in The New Geography of Jobs claims, “single handedly pulled America from the
uncertainties of the Great Depression to the stability of the postwar years...” (Enrico Moretti, 2013).

  Though once this nation’s primary economic driver, the manufacturing industry throughout the
United States has been in decline since the 70s and 80s. Moretti mentions that “since 1985 the US has
lost an average of 372,000 manufacturing [related] jobs every year” (Enrico Moretti). Chicago, like its
Midwest counterparts has not been immune to the national trends. Though once this nation’s second largest 
industrial center (Cutler, 2006), manufacturing jobs here in Chicago dramatically dropped in response
to a plethora of reasons – union strikes, mechanization, downsizing, company relocation, etc. According to the
encyclopedia of Chicago History, the manufacturing industry in the city peaked in 1947 at 667,407 workers and
plummeted to about a fifth of that, 147,000 workers, as of the year 2000.

  Evidence of Chicago’s once bustling manufacturing industry can be seen in the remnants of the
Stock Yards, Pullman, the Calumet region, Goose Island, and many other areas across the city. These,
areas (some more than others) have been shaped and built for an industrial job anchor, and, as a result,
have suffered in many different ways because of the shutdown, reduction, or relocation of such 
industrial job anchors many years ago. The city has termed these areas as “Industrial Corridors” - areas 
who have historically or still operate manufacturing related industry

  This package, though basic in its content, aims to be used as a tool to demonstrate the changes in demographic 
and economic variables throughout the City of Chicago over the 1980-2020 period.
